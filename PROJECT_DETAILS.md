# Trip Planner Agent App - Details

### Agent architecture

The agents system uses **LangGraph** to implement a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with intelligent routing and specialized processing nodes.

#### **System Overview**

- **Supervisor Pattern**: Main supervisor routes conversations to specialized sub-agents
- **Multi-Modal**: Handles both general chat and complex trip planning workflows
- **Rich UI Integration**: Generates interactive React components for user engagement

#### **Core Components**

**Supervisor Graph** (`/supervisor`)

- **Router Node**: Analyzes user intent using GPT-4o-mini to classify requests
- **General Input**: Handles casual conversations as "Breno" assistant
- **Trip Planner**: Routes complex travel requests to specialized sub-graph

**Trip Planner Sub-Graph** (`/trip-planner`)

- **Classification Node**: Validates relevance of existing trip details against new requests
- **Extraction Node**: Intelligently extracts travel parameters (origin, destination, dates, passengers)
- **Tools Node**: Executes travel actions (search flights/hotels, book/cancel reservations)

#### **Routing Intelligence**

```
START ‚Üí Router ‚Üí [Trip Planner | General Chat] ‚Üí END
              ‚Üì
   Trip Planning Flow:
   START ‚Üí [Classify | Extract] ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí END
```

#### **State Management**

- **Typed Annotations**: Strongly-typed state for each graph level
- **Trip Context**: Persistent trip details across conversation turns
- **UI State**: Manages generative React components and tool responses

#### **Available Tools**

- `list-flight-itineraries`: Display flight options with rich UI
- `list-accommodations`: Show hotel recommendations
- `book-flight`: Process flight reservations
- `cancel-flight`: Handle booking cancellations

#### **Component Registration**

All main generative components are registered in `apps/web/src/agent-uis/index.tsx`:

```typescript
const componentMap = {
  "accommodations-list": AccommodationsList,
  "flight-itineraries-list": FlightItinerariesList,
  "flight-booking-confirmation": FlightBookingConfirmation,
  "flight-cancellation-confirmation": FlightCancellationConfirmation,
} as const;
```

#### **Integration Pattern**

- **Tool-Driven**: Main components (`AccommodationsList`, `FlightItinerariesList`) listen to specific `toolCallId` responses
- **State Management**: Uses LangGraph SDK's `useStreamContext` for real-time updates
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Components show different states (loading ‚Üí selection ‚Üí booking ‚Üí confirmation)
- **Reusable Cards**: Modular card components for individual items (flights, accommodations)

### Trade-offs & decisions

#### **üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Framework Choices**

**LangGraph vs. Alternative Agent Frameworks**

- **Decision**: Chose LangGraph over alternatives like CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom implementations
- **Trade-off**: Higher learning curve and LangChain ecosystem lock-in vs. powerful state management and native streaming UI support
- **Rationale**: LangGraph's built-in support for conditional routing, state persistence, and React UI generation aligned perfectly with the multi-agent travel assistant requirements

**Hierarchical Agent Architecture**

- **Decision**: Implemented supervisor pattern with specialized sub-agents rather than single large agent
- **Trade-off**: Increased complexity and latency vs. better separation of concerns and maintainability
- **Rationale**: Supervisor routing allows for better prompt specialization, easier debugging, and cleaner state management for different conversation contexts

**Monorepo Structure with Turborepo**

- **Decision**: Used Turborepo monorepo instead of separate repositories or single codebase
- **Trade-off**: Initial setup complexity vs. shared dependencies and coordinated development
- **Rationale**: Enables code sharing between agents and web app while maintaining clear boundaries and independent deployments

#### **ü§ñ LLM & AI Implementation Choices**

**Model Selection Strategy**

- **Decision**: Mix of GPT-4o for complex reasoning tasks and GPT-4o-mini for routing/classification
- **Trade-off**: Cost optimization vs. consistent model behavior across all nodes
- **Rationale**: Router and classification tasks don't need heavy reasoning power, saving ~90% on API costs for these frequent operations

**Temperature & Determinism Settings**

- **Decision**: Used temperature=0 for extraction and classification, higher for general chat
- **Trade-off**: Predictable outputs vs. creative responses where appropriate
- **Rationale**: Trip planning requires consistent structured data extraction, while general conversation benefits from more natural variability

**Tool Calling vs. Text Responses**

- **Decision**: Enforced tool calling for all trip-related actions instead of allowing text fallbacks
- **Trade-off**: More rigid conversation flow vs. guaranteed UI generation and proper state updates
- **Rationale**: Ensures every booking/search action generates the appropriate React components and maintains consistent user experience

#### **üé® Frontend & UI Decisions**

**Generative UI vs. Static Components**

- **Decision**: Built React components that are dynamically generated by agents rather than pre-built forms
- **Trade-off**: Implementation complexity vs. adaptive user experience that responds to conversation context
- **Rationale**: Allows for contextual UI that adapts to user's specific trip details and conversation history

**Next.js with Client-Side State Management**

- **Decision**: Used Next.js with React hooks instead of server-side rendering or external state managers
- **Trade-off**: Client-side complexity vs. real-time streaming capabilities
- **Rationale**: LangGraph's streaming SDK requires client-side state management for real-time UI updates

**Tailwind CSS with Radix UI Components**

- **Decision**: Chose utility-first CSS with unstyled component primitives
- **Trade-off**: Verbose className attributes vs. rapid prototyping and consistent design system
- **Rationale**: Enables fast iteration on AI-generated components while maintaining accessibility and design consistency

#### **üíæ Data & State Management**

**Prisma ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL**

- **Decision**: Used Prisma for database interactions instead of raw SQL or other ORMs
- **Trade-off**: Bundle size and abstraction overhead vs. type safety and migration management
- **Rationale**: Provides excellent TypeScript integration and database schema evolution capabilities for the complex trip planning data model

**In-Memory vs. Persistent Trip State**

- **Decision**: Trip details persist in LangGraph state during conversation but don't automatically save to database
- **Trade-off**: Faster interactions vs. conversation recovery after disconnection
- **Rationale**: Optimizes for conversation flow speed while planning future persistent storage implementation

**Shared Types Across Monorepo**

- **Decision**: Duplicated some type definitions instead of creating fully shared packages
- **Trade-off**: Type maintenance overhead vs. implementation speed
- **Rationale**: Faster development iteration while acknowledging technical debt that needs future refactoring

#### **üîß Development & DevOps Choices**

**TypeScript Everywhere**

- **Decision**: Full TypeScript adoption across all packages
- **Trade-off**: Longer initial development vs. runtime safety and better developer experience
- **Rationale**: Complex agent interactions and data flow require strong type safety to prevent runtime errors

**Testing Strategy Gaps**

- **Decision**: Limited test coverage initially to prioritize feature development
- **Trade-off**: Faster iteration vs. production stability
- **Rationale**: Proof-of-concept phase prioritized working functionality over comprehensive test coverage

**Local Development vs. Cloud Services**

- **Decision**: Designed for local development with environment variables for API keys
- **Trade-off**: Easier debugging and iteration vs. production-ready infrastructure
- **Rationale**: Enables rapid development cycles while planning future cloud deployment architecture

#### **üéØ Product & UX Trade-offs**

**Conversational vs. Form-Based Interface**

- **Decision**: Pure conversational interface instead of traditional booking forms
- **Trade-off**: Learning curve for users vs. more natural interaction paradigm
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates AI capabilities while providing a differentiated user experience from traditional travel booking sites

**Real-time Streaming vs. Request-Response**

- **Decision**: Implemented streaming responses for all agent interactions
- **Trade-off**: Implementation complexity vs. responsive user experience
- **Rationale**: Creates more engaging interactions and provides immediate feedback during potentially long-running operations

**Default Values Strategy**

- **Decision**: Hardcoded sensible defaults (New York origin, 2 guests) when information is missing
- **Trade-off**: Assumptions may be incorrect vs. smooth conversation flow
- **Rationale**: Prevents conversation from getting stuck while allowing users to correct assumptions naturally
